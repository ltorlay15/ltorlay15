- 👋 Hi, I’m @ltorlay15
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, data science, IoT, and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about novelty detection edge cases. How can we distinguish between two peoples faces
      if we only have access to one of the individuals photos? Now what if they are twins? How would we focus in 
      on these more subtle differences?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most things machine learning and cybersecurity related. 
- 📫 Please leave a comment or chat if you would like to get in touch.
